# Totem Meccano Binaries Repository

This repo contains pre-compiled binaries for quickly setting up a Totem Meccano node.

Select the version for your operating system and simply execute the binary.

## Instructions

Clone the repo

    git clone https://gitlab.com/totem-tech/totem-meccano-binaries.git

Execute the version you need. For exampl this is the binary version `1.1.9` compiled for `Ubuntu 18.04`:

    ./totem-meccano-binaries/ubuntu-18-04/v1.1.9/totem-meccano

## Known issues

We have a known issue that later versions do not often connect to the network directly. In that case follow these instructions after you have tried and been unsuccessful:

Clean up the data directory completely
    
    rm -r .local/share/totem-meccano

This will remove all the key files chain data and peer node registries.

Execute the version `1.1.6` binary temporarily just until you see a number of peers on the network, and a large number of blocks are seen in `target` in the console. 

    ./totem-meccano-binaries/ubuntu-18-04/v1.1.6/totem-meccano

Then stop the node, and either execute the latest version of the binary (currently `1.1.9`) 

    ./totem-meccano-binaries/ubuntu-18-04/v1.1.9/totem-meccano

What this workaround appears to do is correctly identify the bootnodes and store them in the peer nodes registry as well as syncing the genesis block from the bootnodes.  

The issue is that specifying the bootnodes manually does not work even when executing for the first time.
